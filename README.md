For the detection and prevention of disease of plants from getting spread, this paper discussed a system using Python. For the image analysis, the k-means clustering algorithm was used. It has many advantages for the use in big farms of crops and thus it automatically detects signs of disease whenever they appear on leaves of the plant. The term disease means the type of damage to the plants. In pharmaceutical research of leaf disease detection is necessary and important topic for research because it has advantages in monitoring crops in field at the form and thus it automatically detects symptoms of disease by image processing by k-means clustering algorithm. 

This paper provides the best method for detection of plant diseases using image processing and alerting about the disease caused by displaying the name of the disease on the monitor display of the owner of the system. To upgrade agricultural products, automatic detection of disease symptoms is useful. The design and implementation of these technologies which is totally automatic and it will significantly help in the chemical application. It will reduce the cost required for the pesticides and other products. This will lead to increase in productivity of the farming.
